# MultipleProviderEpisodes
This repository contains a series of SAS programming codes to extract, identify, and analyze trends in patients with multiple provider episodes using PROC SQL.

# About this example
This example uses a variety of basic and advanced SAS programming procedures, such as macro variables, SQL, SAS Views, and formats, to work with prescription drug monitoring program data. 

According to the PDMP Training and Technical Assistance Center, "Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) are highly effective tools utilized by government officials for reducing prescription drug abuse and diversion. PDMPs collect, monitor, and analyze electronically transmitted prescribing and dispensing data submitted by pharmacies and dispensing practitioners. The data are used to support statesâ€™ efforts in education, research, enforcement and abuse prevention. PDMPs are managed under the auspices of a state, district, commonwealth, or territory of the United States." 

This SAS program may be resuable to other pharmacy claims data that has at least a date variable for the prescription transaction, a unique patient identifier, a prescriber/provider identifier, and a pharmacy/dispensary identifier.
